And

Note - first link does not specify file type, second link specifies JPG - so JPG selected for screenshots (PNG is a must for icons)

|Application package | Dimensions | Format | Maximum Size | 
|----------------|--------|--------|--------|
|Application screenshot image | 1280x720 px or 1920x1080 px | JPG | 500 kB |


- 1920 X 1080 px
- JPG
- 500kB or less
- names must be screenshot_appname0X.png (where X is the image number)

Screenshots might need to be taken on a server with only child appropriate content to prevent any issues with the app age rating.

## Images Selected

- [X] [Home page image](./screenshot_jellyfin01.png)
