[here](https://developer.samsung.com/tv-seller-office/application-publication-process.html#Publishing-New-Applications):

Note - first link does not specify file type, second link specifies JPG - so JPG selected for screenshots (PNG is a must for icons)


- 1920 X 1080 px
- JPG
- 500kB or less
- names must be screenshot_appname0X.png (where X is the image number)

Screenshots might need to be taken on a server with only child appropriate content to prevent any issues with the app age rating.

## Images Selected

- [X] [Movies page image](./screenshot_jellyfin02.png)
